Command: “:MS#”	Resonse: “1” if command accepted,
“0” The desired object is below 0 degrees altitude.
Slew to the most recently defined RA and DEC coordinates or most recently defined ALT and AZI
coordinates. Slewing is performed at the currently selected slew rate. If the object is below the
horizon, this will be stated, and no slewing will occur.

This command get the slewing status.

Command: “:Q#”	Resonse: “1”
This command will stop slewing. Tracking and moving by arrow keys will not be affected

Note: Motion will be difficult to detect since it is slow.

This command returns whether the telescope is tracking

Notes:
driveSidereal     0    Sidereal tracking rate (15.0 arcseconds per sidereal second).
driveLunar        1    Lunar tracking rate (14.685 arcseconds per second).
driveSolar        2    Solar tracking rate (15.0 arcseconds per second).
driveKing         3    King tracking rate (15.0369 arcseconds per second).

Command: “:QT#”	Resonse: “0” Sidereal rate
“1” Lunar rate
“2” Solar rate
“3” King rate
“4” Custom rate
This command gets the tracking rate.

Command: “:RT0#” “:RT1#” “:RT2#” “:RT3#” “:RT4#”	Resonse: “1”
This command selects the tracking rate. It selects sidereal (:RT0#), lunar (:RT1#), solar (:RT2#),
King (:RT3#), or custom (“:RT4#”). The sidereal rate is assumed as a default by the next power up.
This command has no effect on the use of the N-S-E-W buttons.

Note: Error in manual. Parking commands do not work (no response from mount)
Command: “:AP#”	Resonse: “0” Un-parking state,
“1” Parking state.
This command gets the parking status.

Command: “:AP#”	Resonse: “0” Un-parking state,
“1” Parking state.
This command gets the parking status.

Command: “:MP0#”	Resonse: “1”
This command un-parks the telescope.

Command: “:MP1#”	Resonse: “1”
This command invokes the parked mode. In parked mode, the telescope cannot slew, track, and
guide unless a un-park command is issued.
Caution: Any movement caused by hand controller will make the telescope into un-park state.

Command: “:pS#”	Resonse: “0” East,
“1” West.
This command returns the side of the pier on which the telescope is currently positioned. It is useful
for remote observatories where it is not possible for the viewer to see the mount. Initially, the
mount must be manually positioned on the proper pier side for the calibration object and calibrated
using the :CM# command.

Command: “:MH#”
Respond: “1”
This command will slew to the “home” position immediately.

Command: “:AH#”
Respond: “0” The telescope is not at “home” position,
“1” The telescope is at “home” position.
This command returns whether the telescope is at “home” position.

Command: “:SRn#”	Resonse: “1”
Sets the moving rate used for the N-S-E-W buttons. For n, specify an integer from 1 to 9. 1 stands
for 1x sidereal tracking rate, 2 stands for 2x, 3 stands for 8x, 4 stands for 16x, 5 stands for 64x, 6
stands for 128x, 7 stands for 256x, 8 stands for 512x, 9 stands for maximum speed(larger than
512x).

Note: Error in manual. This command does not work!
Command: “:RR snn.nnnn#”	Resonse: “1”
“Custom Tracking Rate”(“:RT4#”) must be selected before this command to take effect.
The command selects the tracking rate in the RA axis to nn.nnnn. The rate added to the standard
sidereal rate and can be positive or negative. In equatorial mounts, snn.nnnn is limited to the range
of -0.0100 to +0.0100.

Note: N/A
Command: “:RD snn.nnnn#”	Resonse: “1”
This command only works with Alt-Azi Mounts. “Custom Tracking Rate” (“:RT4#”) must be
selected before this command to take effect.
The command selects the tracking rate in the DEC axis to nn.nnnn. The rate added to the standard
sidereal rate and can be positive or negative.

Note: East and West appear to be inverted. Need to double check!
Command: “:mn#” “:me#” “:ms#” “:mw#”	Resonse: (none)
These commands have identical function as pressed arrow key. They will move mounts to N-E-SW direction at specified speed (may change by “:SRn#”). The mount will keep moving until a
“:q#” sent.

Command: “:q#”	Resonse: (none)
This commands will stop moving by arrow keys or “:mn#”, “:me#”, “:ms#”, “:mw#” command.
Slewing and tracking will not be affected.

Command: “:Gr#”	Resonse: “n#”
Gets the moving rate used for the N-S-E-W buttons. For n, specify an integer from 1 to 9. 1 stands
for 1x sidereal tracking rate, 2 stands for 2x, 3 stands for 8x, 4 stands for 16x, 5 stands for 64x, 6
stands for 128x, 7 stands for 256x, 8 stands for 512x, 9 stands for maximum speed(larger than
512x).

Position

Command: “:CM#”	Resonse: “1”
Calibrate mount (Sync). If in equatorial mounts or in RA-DEC mode with Alt-Azi mounts, Current
Right Ascension and Declination become the commanded Right Ascension and Declination
respectively. If in Alt-Azi mode (only works with Alt-Azi mounts), then the commanded Altitude
and Azimuth become the current. This command assumes that the mount has been manually
positioned on the proper pier side for the calibration object. This command is ignored if slewing is
in progress. This command should be used for initial calibration. It should not be used after the
mount has been tracking unless it is known that it has not tracked across the meridian.

Command: “:Sr HH:MM:SS#”	Resonse: “1”
Defines the commanded Right Ascension, RA. This command automatically selects RA-DEC mode.
Move and calibrate commands operate on the most recently defined RA.

Command: “:Sd sDD*MM:SS#”	Resonse: “1”
Defines the commanded Declination, DEC. This command automatically selects RA-DEC mode.
Move and calibrate commands operate on the most recently defined DEC.

Command: “:Sa sDD*MM:SS#”	Resonse: “1”
This command only works with Alt-Azi Mounts. Defines the commanded Altitude, ALT.
Move and calibrate commands operate on the most recently defined ALT.
This command automatically selects Alt-Azi mode, however tracking rate is unaffected.Command: “:Sz DDD*MM:SS#”	Resonse: “1”
This command only works with Alt-Azi Mounts. Defines the commanded Azimuth, AZI.
Move and calibrate commands operate on the most recently defined AZI. This command automati
cally selects Alt-Azi mode, however tracking rate is unaffected.
